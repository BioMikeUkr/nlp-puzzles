Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n\nPython is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It has a comprehensive standard library and is often described as a 'batteries included' language due to its extensive modules and packages.\n\nCommon use cases for Python include web development (Django, Flask), data analysis (pandas, NumPy), machine learning (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), automation, and scripting.",

There are three main types:\n\n1. Supervised Learning:\n   - Model learns from labeled training data\n   - Examples: classification, regression\n   - Algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks\n   - Use cases: spam detection, price prediction\n\n2. Unsupervised Learning:\n   - Model finds patterns in unlabeled data\n   - Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction\n   - Algorithms: K-means, PCA, autoencoders\n   - Use cases: customer segmentation, anomaly detection\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning:\n   - Model learns through trial and error with rewards\n   - Examples: game playing, robotics\n   - Algorithms: Q-learning, policy gradients\n   - Use cases: AlphaGo, autonomous driving\n\nKey concepts:\n- Training set: Data used to train the model\n- Test set: Data used to evaluate model performance\n- Overfitting: Model performs well on training data but poorly on new data\n- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model generalization",
